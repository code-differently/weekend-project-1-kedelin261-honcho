# RANDOM RECEIPT GENERATOR
## Developer : Kenny Edelin

### Main.java
In this class, you will see my main method that allows my receipt to RUN.

### Receipt.java
In this class, you will see sections for User Inout, as well as Random Data generations. User Input, consist of my three question inquiring about Name, Budget and Vip code.

### PriceGenerator.java
In this class, you will see mostly random data generators. Generating item prices, as well as random discounts, mystery adjustments, tax rates and rounded totals.

### CodeGenerator.java
This class consist of if/else statements that build the receipt code. These if/else statements are based on the length of user input. There are also return statements to specify what my output should be.

### ReceiptGenerator.java
This class has all contents that the receipt includes, which in return calls for a lot of print statements. Also, I tried my best to separate each section on the receipt with hyphens.

### CLOSING
Thank you for using and analyzing my Random Receipt Generator with me!
